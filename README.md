# StrongholdsOfConquest_

A complete rework of the Stronghold Crusader Ai castle layouts based on historical examples, while keeping the productivity and the fighting power of the Ai characters on a challenging level.

Apart from a couple of examples, all castles used are based on historic plans reconstructions and other documentation to represent the castles as close as possible while being restricted by the available space and character limitations, in terms of economy.
Keep in mind the castles are developed with the [USCP](https://github.com/Sh0wdown/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/releases) in mind so if you got problems with the AI economy make sure to get it from here and see if the problem persists.

Here are Ingame examples of one castle of each character with a list of names of the actual place and the file they are located in for reference. (screenshots are taken is a personal edit of mine which can be downloaded from here not that it does have a few glichty problems which will hopefully get figured out eventually)
