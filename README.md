# StrongholdsOfConquest_

A complete rework of the Stronghold Crusader AI castles based on historical examples. Featuring realistic and unique designs, while bringing productivity and fighting power of the AI characters to a challenging level.

Apart from a couple of examples (which will get updated), all castles are based on historial plans, reconstructions and other documentations to represent the castles as close as possible while being restricted by the available space and character limitations, in terms of economy.

Keep in mind the AIVs are developed with the [USCP](https://github.com/Sh0wdown/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/releases) in mind so if you have issues with the AI economy not getting off the ground, make sure to get it from [here](https://github.com/Sh0wdown/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/releases) and see if the problem persists.


Here are Ingame examples of one castle of each character with a list of names of the actual place and the file they are located in for reference. (screenshots are taken in a personal edit of mine for the game which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Monsterfisch/StrongholdsOfConquest_/blob/master/StrongholdsOfConquest_VisualEdit.zip) not that it does have a few glichty problems which will hopefully get figured out eventually)
