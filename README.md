# StrongholdsOfConquest_

A complete rework of the Stronghold Crusader Ai castle layouts based on historical examples, while keeping the productivity and the fighting power of the Ai characters on a challenging level.

Apart from a couple of examples, all castles used are based on historic plans reconstructions and other documentation to represent the castles as close as possible while being restricted by the available space and character limitations, in terms of economy.

Here are Ingame examples of one castle of each character with a list of names of the actual place and the file they are located in for reference.
